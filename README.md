## Zaronology Booklist Assesment

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Booklist Project - containing Books matched with Authors and Genres
- Eloquent relationships
- database migration files
- database seeder files
- 1 route endpoint to index display list of books (simple bootstrap HTML CSS)
